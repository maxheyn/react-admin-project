# react-admin-project

A project for the Fall 2020 Web Application Programming course at Clemson.

We created a simple React Admin webpage that was integrated with a redis database that we made in an earlier project.
The webpage and the database were hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, but are no longer hosted since the semester has commenced.
